Let’s look at what exactly you can build and ship on Sui blockchain in detail.

1. **Commerce:** Sui’s architecture and design allows for lightning-fast transactions that can even skip the time-consuming consensus steps. This is super useful for applications in the realm of commerce, as nobody wants to wait for consensus on their cup of coffee.
2. **DeFi:** Developers wanting to build DeFi applications in Sui have many unique tools at their fingertip – programmable transaction blocks, sponsored transactions, deepbook, etc. – all with the speed, cost-efficiency, and throughput that Sui offers.
3. **Games:** As mentioned before, games are latency-sensitive and Sui can support extremely low latency transactions which can be processed in parallel. Not only this, but Sui’s architecture is built to handle massive throughput demands - something extremely important to a highly played game.
