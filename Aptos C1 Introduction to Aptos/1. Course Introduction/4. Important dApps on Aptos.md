## DApps on Aptos

Now, for the blockchain to become this hub of super cool applications, it needs to enable certain things for the developers who build the application and users who use that application. In the case of Aptos, as we already discussed in the previous lesson, it comes with features like Move language support, parallel transaction execution, modular architecture, and a novel data model approach which enables the protocol to have higher scalability, security, and transaction processing capability.

All this leads to a better development experience for the developer and a rich user experience for the end user. This makes the protocol a suitable playground for a variety of applications that cover a wide range of use cases from deFi, social media, token exchanges, and even games and marketplaces.

Here are some of the most in-demand categories of applications from the Aptos ecosystem.
