## Apps on Aptos

Now, in order for the blockchain to become this hub of super cool applications, it needs to enable certain things for the developers who build the application and users who use that application. In the case of Aptos, as we already discussed in the previous chapter, It comes with features like Move language support, parallel transaction execution, modular architecture and novel data model approaches which enables the protocol to have higher scalability, security and transaction processing capability. 

All this leads to a better development experience for the developer and a rich user experience for the end user.  This makes the protocol a suitable playground for a variety of  applications that cover a wide range of use cases from Defi, Social Media, Token Exchanges and even Games and marketplaces
