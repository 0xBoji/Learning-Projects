# How Does Aptos Even Work? (Part-II) 

Welcome back, folks!! In the last lesson we learned how Aptos works in a brief and also dug deep into the why you should be learning move over solidity. Well in this lesson, let’s dig deep further into how Aptos works and what makes it faster than other blockchains.

Okay, let me reveal the secret sauce: it’s **Parallel Execution**!!

## Aptos parallel execution model

Imagine having multiple checkout lanes open at once, but with a twist! Transactions are still grouped into batches, like carts full of goods. However, with parallel processing, it's like cashiers (validators) can grab individual items (transactions) from different carts and scan them simultaneously, as long as they're not the same item (data). This significantly speeds things up, making Aptos perfect for shops(dApps) that need speedy transactions!

**But wait, how does it avoid chaos?** Here's where our super-smart coordinator, **Block-STM**, comes in. It keeps everything organized and prevents mix-ups, even when multiple customers (transactions) try to buy the same item (data).

**Let's see how this works with two different scenarios:**

For the first scenario, imagine two customers, Alice and Bob, want to buy separate items from the same shop (transactions in the same batch). With parallel processing, cashiers (validators) can scan their items (transactions) simultaneously because they're not trying to buy the same thing (data). This is super efficient!

Now, imagine Alice wants to buy a hat, and then Bob wants to buy the same hat after her (conflicting transactions). Block-STM, our super-smart coordinator, comes into play here. It might let Bob scan the hat first (speculative execution), but then realize there's a conflict with Alice's purchase (earlier transaction). In this case, Bob's transaction would be put on hold and re-attempted later, ensuring only one person gets the hat.

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Batching & Sharing:** Transactions are grouped into batches, like carts, then shared with everyone in the marketplace (validators) to keep everyone informed.
2. **Parallel Processing Power:** Block-STM lets these transactions be processed at the same time, even if they involve different items (data) from the same cart (batch). It tracks everything and only lets one purchase (transaction) go through if there's a conflict with the same item.
3. **Double-Checking & Storing:** Once everything's processed, Block-STM makes sure everything is legit, then the changes (like updated shop inventory) are stored permanently.

I hope now you have gained a good amount of knowledge on how Aptos works! Well in the coming lessons you will be learning a lot more about Aptos and why you should build on it. 

## Wrap up

By leveraging parallel execution, Aptos can process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms out there. It's like having a bustling marketplace that can handle a massive influx of customers without breaking a sweat!
