# How Does Aptos Even Work? (Part-I) 

Hey! Back for another round of Aptos knowledge?

Okay let‚Äôs do a quick recap, we've covered what Aptos is and what it's all about, but you might be wondering: **how does this whole thing actually work?**

This is where things get interesting. As developers, we naturally love diving into the nitty-gritty of how something is built.  Ô∏èIn this lesson, we're going to take a deep dive into the core workings of the Aptos blockchain.

Okay now buckle up! This lesson is going to be a bit detailed but hold tight as I will walk you through every detailed with examples you can relate.

## Overview of Aptos core working principles

Hey there! We've been exploring Aptos, but you might be curious: what makes this town tick?

Imagine Aptos like a busy marketplace with a constant flow of goods. Transactions are like these goods, carefully packed in boxes (blocks) before entering the town. Validators act as the security guards, checking each box thoroughly before it gets delivered.

Now, with multiple guards, how do we know they're all honest? Well, Aptos, like any good town, has a set of rules everyone follows (consensus mechanism). In Aptos, this rulebook is called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Think of it as a system where guards with a higher stake in the town's safety (holding more digital currency) have a greater say in validating transactions.

Every busy town needs a record keeper, right? In Aptos, these are the librarians ‚Äì the full nodes. They meticulously record every transaction (data on the blockchain) since the town's founding. You can access all this information through them, just like a giant history book! But what if you only need the latest news, not the whole story? That's where light clients come in. These are like librarians who let you access just the most recent box (block) of information.

Now, imagine these merchants in the marketplace aren't just selling goods, but also offering services. These services are like smart contracts ‚Äì self-executing agreements that follow a specific set of rules.

But how do we ensure these services are reliable and secure? Here's where Move language comes in. It's like a super clear instruction manual for merchants, written in a language everyone can understand. This manual helps them create secure and dependable smart contracts, so the chances of merchants making errors are low since they already have a clear instruction manual.

But what if there's a sudden surge of customers, and merchants struggle to handle all the requests at once? Aptos has a clever trick up its sleeve called Block-STM. This word might sound too technical but Imagine it like a system that lets merchants group similar orders together and process them efficiently, even during peak shopping hours. This keeps the marketplace running smoothly, even with complex transactions. 

This might seem like a lot to take in , But don‚Äôt worry we will be going through them step by step and explain everything in detail. 

## Why Move Over Solidity?

Imagine our bustling marketplace again, but this time, we have two types of instruction manuals for our merchants: Solidity and Move.

Solidity is like an older, more complex manual. It gets the job done, but it's easy for merchants to make mistakes or misinterpret the instructions. This can lead to security issues, like a merchant (Smart contracts) accidentally leaving their store unlocked overnight (Security flaws caused due to logical errors).

On the other hand, Move is like a well-organized manual that's designed with safety and clarity in mind. It's like having a step-by-step guide with pictures and diagrams, making it much easier for merchants (Smart Contracts) to follow along and avoid mistakes. In Move, it‚Äôs built in to protect against common smart contract vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks (YOU really have to google it!! People lost millions due to this one flaw in Solidity)

One of Move's superpowers is its resource-oriented design.

Think of these resources as secure vaults within your shop. These vaults are special because they follow a strict set of rules:

- **Unique and Valuable:** Just like precious items in your shop, resources represent something of value in the marketplace (Smart contract).
- **Can't Be Duplicated:** Imagine having a magic machine that can't copy your most valuable items. Well you don‚Äôt need one for ‚ÄúResources‚Äù as they can't be copied or counterfeited, ensuring their authenticity.
- **Only One Location:** Each valuable item in your shop has its own designated space in the vault, right? Likewise, resources can only exist in one place at a time, preventing confusion about ownership.

Well there are a lot of things to talk about move and why this is going to be the next big smart contract language, but for now this is it, we will talk more about it in the next course, maybe deploy some smart contract in move, who knows ‚Ä¶. üòâ

## Wrap up

The lesson gives a snapshot of Aptos's core principles: strong validators, fast transactions with Move, and smooth transaction management. It also explains how transactions work on Aptos, ensuring security and efficiency. Overall, it shows why Aptos is a solid choice for blockchain development.
