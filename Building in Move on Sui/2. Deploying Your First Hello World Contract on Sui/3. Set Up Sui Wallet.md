Welcome back! So you completed learning about Sui and Move programming language. Well in this lesson, you're going to learn how to set up your Sui wallet. Ready for another round of exhilarating learning? Let's dive right in!

## Setup Sui wallet

Let’s install the Sui wallet so you can deploy your contract.

You can add it easily using the browser extension. For Chrome, go to [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil) link and then add it to Chrome.

Currently, this is set to Mainnet, you can hover over the settings icon in the top right corner. Go to Network and change to the desired network. We are changing to the Devnet network as we deployed our contract to the Devnet network.
