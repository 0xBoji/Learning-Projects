        15. After creating the client ID, the following page will appear. Copy the Client ID. We will paste this client ID to our `.env` file in the frontend.
        
        ![google-setup-18.png](Set%20Up%20the%20Google%20Credentials%20c87e5c7f8cc240759e84bab4662f6977/google-setup-18.png)

16. Lastly, we need to make our app public on Google Cloud. So that anyone, including you, can log in without any restrictions. To do this, head over to the “OAuth consent screen” from the side bar and click on the “Publish App” button.

## Paste the Client ID to the .env file

Head back to your front end and find the `.env` file. If not present, please create the file at root directory. Paste the following line to `.env` file and replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with the Client ID you copied from the Google cloud.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID_GOOGLE=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
```

## That’s a wrap

Great work on setting up the Google Cloud client ID. In the next lesson, we will set up the ZK login and get our front end running.
