# Deploy the DApp on the Fuel Blockchain

Kudos to you for making it so far! Now we will finally deploy our dApp on the Fuel blockchain. 

## Deploy the dApp

Open a new terminal in your Blockstay-dApp directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened. 

Run the following command to build your files:

```
forc build
```

Now let’s deploy the dApp using the following command:

```
forc deploy --testnet
```

- Once you use this command, it will ask you your password of the wallet.
- After you provide the correct password, you will then be asked to provide the index of the account to use for signing - here you can write **0**.
- Lastly, you will be asked if you agree to sign this transaction. You can type **y** to approve the transaction.

The output should look like so:

## That’s a wrap

In conclusion, we learned how to deploy a dApp on the Fuel blockchain. We built our files using `forc build` and deployed the dApp using `forc deploy --testnet`. Now, let's add the frontend to our dApp.
