# Connect this Yeezy to Twitter
---
Yo, listen up! We 'bout to make some moves and get connected to Twitter using MindsDB SQL statement. 

## Create database

First, we gonna create a fresh new database called `my_twitter` with the `twitter` engine. This database comes equipped with a dope table called `tweets` that we can use to find and write tweets. Use this query:

```jsx
CREATE DATABASE my_twitter
WITH ENGINE = 'twitter';
```

## Use twitter API

Peep this, to get a list of tweets with specific text or hashtags like mindsdb or #mindsdb, we can use the Twitter API. Let's get it by running this query:

```jsx
SELECT 
   id, created_at, author_username, text 
FROM my_twitter.tweets 
WHERE 
   query = '(@kanye OR @kanyewest OR #KanyeWest OR #kanyewest OR #ye OR #Yeezy) -is:retweet' 
   AND created_at > '2023-04-04' 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Test the model

Alright, listen up. We're about to test this model and see if it can handle the Kanye West personality on a whole bunch of tweets. So what we're gonna do is join this model with the tweets table. And trust me, we're gonna get some fire responses outta this thing. Let's go! Run this query:

```jsx
SELECT 
t.id AS in_reply_to_tweet_id, 
t.text AS input_text, 
t.author_username, 
t.created_at, 
r.response AS text 
FROM my_twitter.tweets t 
JOIN mindsdb.kanye_chat r 
WHERE t.query = '(@kanye OR @kanyewest OR #KanyeWest OR #kanyewest OR #ye OR #Yeezy) -is:retweet -from:kanye_chat' 
AND t.created_at >  '2023-04-01' 
LIMIT 10;
```

This code is a SQL statement that selects data from two tables: **`my_twitter.tweets`** and **`mindsdb.kanye_chat`** and then joins the two tables using a **`WHERE`** clause.

## Explanation

Here is what each part of the code does:

- **`SELECT`**: This keyword selects the columns we want to display in the output.
- **`t.id AS in_reply_to_tweet_id`**: This renames the column **`id`** from the **`tweets`** table to **`in_reply_to_tweet_id`** in the output.
- **`t.text AS input_text`**: This renames the column **`text`** from the **`tweets`** table to **`input_text`** in the output.
- **`t.author_username`**: This selects the **`author_username`** column from the **`tweets`** table in the output.
- **`t.created_at`**: This selects the **`created_at`** column from the **`tweets`** table in the output.
- **`r.response AS text`**: This renames the column **`response`** from the **`kanye_chat`** table to **`text`** in the output.
- **`FROM my_twitter.tweets t JOIN mindsdb.kanye_chat r`**: This specifies the two tables we want to select data from and then join.
- **`WHERE t.query = '(@kanye OR @kanyewest OR #KanyeWest OR #kanyewest OR #ye OR #Yeezy) -is:retweet -from:kanye_chat'`**: This specifies the conditions that the data we want to select must meet. In this case, we are selecting tweets that match any of the specified keywords but are not retweets and are not from the **`kanye_chat`** account.
- **`AND t.created_at > '2023-04-01'`**: This specifies that we only want to select tweets that were created after April 1, 2023.
- **`LIMIT 10`**: This limits the output to the first 10 rows that meet the specified conditions.
